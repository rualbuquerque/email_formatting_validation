# email_formatting_validation
SQL Code to validate the format of an email address

There are two steps when you are validating an email address:
1) Its format: you will check if there aren't invalid characters; if there is a sequence of valid characters before the @. Then if you have a sequence of valid characters after the @ sign.
2) If the email itself is valid: for that part, you'll need more than lines of code: it will be necessary either cross data from email stats (sending, opens, clicks, bounces, etc.)

   The file you will find here regards the 1st point of the list.
